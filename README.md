# seq-label_analysis
- Exploring the results from multiple alternative fine-tuning runs.
- Should also help logging the activity for reproducibility
- Uses data from https://github.com/egilron/seq-label.git experiments
- excels: full_report has all epochs, best_report uses best epoch only. the _m files have been modified in Excel.



## Log
**01121628**: Lumi, 16 epochs max  
**01150927**: Fox, 20 epochs max. Batch size 64  
Here, the NorBERT-3-based models get results for some of the learning rates. When inspecting the epochs, we do not see anyone starting to pick up the signal after epoch 5.
